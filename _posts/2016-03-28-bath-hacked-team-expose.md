I entered a hackathon called Bath Hack, the aim of this hackathon was to hack around Bathâ€™s past, present and future.
Using all of the open data provided we created a tool that would allow the public to easily examine council expenses.

You can see what we shipped [here](http://expose.112percent.com)

A great write up [here](http://www.112percent.com/dev/bath-hacked-2-1-team-expose/)
