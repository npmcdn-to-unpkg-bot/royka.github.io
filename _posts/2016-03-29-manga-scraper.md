I'm quite a fan of Japanese manga, you can read them online for free but sometimes its best to have a local copy on your ipad or laptop. Rather than download each issue individually I've create a command line tool that will scrap all the issues for a manga from [manga panda](mangapanda.com).

## About the Project
The project is written in [python](python.org) and uses [beautifulsoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

## Source Code
The source code and install instructions can be found in the [github project](https://github.com/royka/manga_scraper)
