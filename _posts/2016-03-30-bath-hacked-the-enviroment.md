I entered BathHacked again! This time we where inspired by a [presentation](http://www.bathhacked.org/bath-hacked-loves-the-environment/ideas-night-local-food-strategy-and-environmental-protection/) given by a local Environmental Protection officer.

## What we Built
We built a web app that allowed the public to examine Environmental Protection service requests. Allowing people to find out trends and see what problems are affecting their area. We allowed people to filter by time as well as type's of requests. Importantly we represented the state of the search in the URL allowing people to share their findings.

## How we Built it
We decided to build a very lean app, exporting the service request data to [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/) (sponsor of the event).

The static app was build with [Angular 2](angular.io), [TypeScript](typescriptlang.org) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

Having a static app meant we could host it on [Figroll](figroll.io)

## Final Result
We managed to ship the [web app](hacked.figroll.it) and win several tickets to a Bath Rugby Match in IPL's box
